 1. [done] We need to generate a file with the grammar commented atop and the
    peg statements below
 2. [done] We need to execute the peg statements to have them vivified in the
    current session
 3. [delayed] We need to add the associated parser to a global hash
 4. [done - calc] We need to test this code on some actual real-world
    PEGs (we could use any and all of our existing ones and eyeball the
    generated output -- and then run the generated code to ensure
    runtime goodness)
 5. [in progress] We need to package a nice lib (interface) for all this
 6. [done - calc] We need at least one good example demonstrating this
    -- better yet, get all of the existing examples and re-design them
    into this new workflow
 7. [done] We need to usr_41 the vimpeg lib itself
 8. [done] Parse vimpeg files as a whole instead of line by line.
 9. [done] Optionally embed vimpeg lib into parser. maybe?
10. [in progress] Do something useful with the debug option.
