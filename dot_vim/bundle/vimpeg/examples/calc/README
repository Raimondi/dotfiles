This is an example of the PEG DSL way of specifying Vimpeg grammars.

This directory (named calc/) is intended to sit under your pathogen bundle/
dir.

The autoload/ subdirectory contains two source files (calculator.vim and
calc.vimpeg) and a third, generated file, called calc.vim.

The plugin/calculator.vim provides the public interface function, Calc().

The test/ directory contains examples of how to call the Calc() function - it
is intended to be converted into a full-blown runVimTests() example.
