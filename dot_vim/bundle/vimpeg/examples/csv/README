This is an example of the PEG DSL way of specifying Vimpeg grammars.

This directory (named csv_parser/) is intended to sit under your pathogen
bundle/ dir.

The autoload/ subdirectory contains two source files (csv_parser.vim and
csv.vimpeg) and a third, generated file, called csv.vim.

The plugin/csv_parser.vim provides the public interface functions,
Parse_CSV(var), and Print_CSV(var).

The test/ directory contains examples of how to call the csv() function - it
is intended to be converted into a full-blown runVimTests() example.
